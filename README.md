## C program to find **Highest Common Divisor** with the help of **Euclid Theorem**

###Example of HCD - 
If we have two numbers 4 and 12  <br>
then divisors of 4 are 1, 2, 4   <br>
and divisors of 12 are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12 <br>
common divisors between 4 and 12 are 1, 2 and 4. Among common divisors 4 is greatest so <br>
we call 4 HCD (Highest Common Divisor) of 4 and 12
